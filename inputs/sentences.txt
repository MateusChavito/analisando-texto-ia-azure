Frustrated employee at the Downtown Cafe
123 Main St, Springfield,
3/15/2025
This place used to have great service, but lately, I've been waiting for over 30 minutes just to get my coffee. The staff seems overwhelmed and uninterested, and it’s really affecting my day. I used to love coming here, but now I’m honestly thinking about finding a new spot to work
